# Give Me Some Space!
## Summer Project Before College

Give Me Some Space! is a shoot â€™em up space combat game created in Javascript.
I created this game around the time I started attending EKU in Fall 2020.
I plan to update it soon but want to upload the game in this state as it will be good to compare my skills from so long ago to my abilities now.
